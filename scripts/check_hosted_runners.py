"""Fail if any workflow targets a GitHub-hosted runner (AUT-5654).

Why this guard exists: on 2026-10-05 the account's hosted-runner spending
limit ran out, and every GitHub-hosted job in this private repo started
failing in 3-6 seconds with zero steps executed and the check-run
annotation "The job was not started because recent account payments have
failed or your spending limit needs to be increased". The failure is
invisible in the workflow log because there is no log — the only evidence
is the annotation, and only if you go looking for it.

The six jobs in this repo were moved to the self-hosted runners, which
fixed CI. What does not exist is anything that stops the next workflow
being added with `runs-on: ubuntu-latest` and silently re-breaking every
push. This script is that stop.

Scope: this repo only. The autobrain repo is public, so GitHub-hosted
runners there are free and still work (AUT-5654 deliberately left its
`ubuntu-latest` jobs alone); converting those would only add load to an
already-busy two-runner fleet.

Run: python3 scripts/check_hosted_runners.py [workflow_dir]
Exit: 0 clean, 1 if any workflow targets a hosted runner.
