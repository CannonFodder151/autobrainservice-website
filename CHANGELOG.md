## [Unreleased]

## [0.3.120] - 2026-08-21

### Security
- Frontend: default API/WS to https/wss; AndroidManifest adds `android:usesCleartextTraffic="false"` (F1)
- Android: release build no longer uses debug keystore; signing config via local.properties/CI secrets (F2)
- Android: `android:allowBackup="false"` blocks ADB/cloud backup of secure storage (F3)
- Password reset token delivered via URL fragment (`#token=`) not query string — removed from logs/history (F4)

## [0.3.119] - 2026-08-21

### Security
- Dev compose: PostgreSQL, Redis, MinIO, and AI gateway bound to 127.0.0.1 (AB-INFRA-004/006) — no external exposure in local dev
- Dev compose: Redis requires auth (REDIS_PASSWORD) — open broker eliminated (AB-INFRA-004)
- Dev compose: AI gateway auth mandatory (AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY) — dev opt-out removed, fail-closed everywhere (AB-INFRA-006)

## [0.3.116] - 2026-08-21

### Added
- Embed-on-create smoke test (AUT-1242-C4): new test suite asserting all five
  entity types produce searchable text, the `_valid_embedding` dimension guard
  rejects malformed vectors, and an integration test confirms every entity type
  stores a non-NULL embedding via the `backfill_entity_embedding` path.

## [0.3.115] - 2026-08-21

### Changed
- Hosted stack (AUT-1242): `minio-init` one-shot sidecar removed from
  `docker-compose.hosted.yml` — bucket init (create + force-private) now runs in
  the minio container's own entrypoint before the server blocks, which waits for
  MinIO to accept connections and stays idempotent. One fewer container to run.

## [0.3.114] - 2026-08-20

### Changed
- Merged the market-data scraper into the AI image (AUT-1242-C3): the separate
  `market-data` container is gone. The AI image now runs both this AI gateway
  (`:8001`) and the CarsGuide/BikeGuide market-data API (`:8000`) via an
  entrypoint wrapper, saving a container in the hosted stack.
- Entrypoint now supervises both processes: whichever uvicorn dies first tears
  the container down so Docker restarts it; prod compose wires the scraper's
  `API_KEY` and exposes `:8000` (AUT-1299).
- Aligned `pydantic` pin across `ai/requirements.txt` and `backend/requirements.txt` to
  `pydantic==2.10.4` (AUT-1298). The divergent pin (`2.13.4` in ai/ vs `2.10.4`
